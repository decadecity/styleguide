# CSS

Indentation: 2 spaces

## Rules

Space after the `:` and no space before the `;`.

Colours are written using *six* digit hex codes, letters are lower case.

When in any doubt, don't use shorthand notation.

## Selectors

Rules within selectors are organised as follows:

  1. Box
  2. Border
  3. Background
  4. Text
  5. Other

[This follows the SMACCS convention.]

## Media queries

Media query to cut the mustard is `@media only all`

Media queries do not contain a medium unless explicitly required.

Min-width media queries are preferred: `@media (min-width: 20em)`

Media queries dimensions are expressed in `em` wherever possible.
