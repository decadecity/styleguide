# Decade City style guide

When I work on an existing code base I will follow the style used there.  This means that I do not inherently follow a specific style so, when working on my own code, I need a reference to ensure consistency.

This style guide is not intended to be objectively the best way to write code, it is an aide memoir for myself when writing code for my own projects.  (Your mileage may vary, past performance is no guarantee of future performance.)

This style guide provides defaults I will use when no established style is present.
