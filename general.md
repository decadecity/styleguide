# General
These are the defaults and hold true unless overridden in a specific language style guide.

Files have a new line at the end.

Trailing spaces are trimmed from lines.

The ternary operator `... ? ... : ...` is not used.

The one true brace style is used:

    if (x < 0) {
        puts("Negative");
        negative(x);
    } else {
        puts("Non-negative");
        nonnegative(x);
    }
