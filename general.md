# General
These are the defaults and hold true unless overridden in a specific language style guide.

Files have a new line at the end.

Trailing spaces are trimmed from lines.

The ternary operator `... ? ... : ...` is not used.

The one true brace style is used:

    if (x < 0) {
        puts("Negative");
        negative(x);
    } else {
        puts("Non-negative");
        nonnegative(x);
    }

Strings are quoted with single quotes.

Comments have one space after the comment marker and are written in properly punctuated sentences.

Spaces are preferred to tabs for indentation.  Spaces and tabs for indentation are *never* mixed.
